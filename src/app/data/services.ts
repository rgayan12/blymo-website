      <li class="text-lg font-bold dark:text-white">Wireframing:</li>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
          <li>Wireframing lays the groundwork for your product's design, focusing on structure and functionality rather than aesthetics.</li>
          <li>We utilize cutting-edge tools to create detailed blueprints, ensuring every aspect of your product is strategically mapped out.</li>
        </ul>
      <li class="mt-4 text-lg font-bold dark:text-white">Low-Fidelity Prototypes:</li>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
          <li>In the early stages, we develop low-fidelity prototypes to showcase core features and interactions.</li>
          <li>These prototypes are quick, inexpensive, and perfect for gathering valuable feedback and iterating rapidly.</li>
        </ul>
      <li class="mt-4 text-lg font-bold dark:text-white">High-Fidelity Prototypes:</li>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
          <li>As your vision takes shape, we transition to high-fidelity prototypes that closely resemble the final product.</li>
          <li>Detailed visuals and realistic interactions provide a comprehensive preview of the user experience.</li>
        </ul>
      <li class="mt-4 text-lg font-bold dark:text-white">Revisioning:</li>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
          <li>Iteration is key to success. We continuously refine and reimagine your design based on feedback and testing results.</li>
          <li>Our iterative approach ensures your product evolves to meet the ever-changing needs of your target audience.</li>
        </ul>
